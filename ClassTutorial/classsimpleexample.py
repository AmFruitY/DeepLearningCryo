"""When we define a class, we are defining a variable or a data structure
in which we define its own atributes and functions. For example, a list-type variable 
has functions that let us access items inside said list."""

"""An instance in python refers to an individual object that is created from a class."""

"""The first thing Python do when we instanciate a class is to execute the method __init__."""

"""self.- is referring to the instance itself."""

"""Inheritance is when you use another class and add more functionality to it. So for example,
I want to create a Neural Network Model based on another, we would have to define it in according to the base model."""

"""Superclass is the model that we are inhereting from."""
